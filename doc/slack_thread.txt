Hi Revit folks - I’m looking to do some data validation on parameters coming out of Revit headed to FDX (for the Power Automate workflow).
Are there any debug tools or other utilities in Revit so I can get a count / csv of Revit parameters on elements in a view?
@Andy Parrella @Dave Fagerstrom @Lou Bianchini @John Thomas @Angel Velez…?

@Tobias Hathorn I had made this spreadsheet that contains the parameters I extracted from some of the models - also attached is the macro I used...

Thank you @Andy Parrella!
I believe @Greg Henry already saw this, but pinging here for follow up questions in thread - I’ll try out the utility!

Lou Bianchini

@Tobias Hathorn Note there are several things you'd want to change about that macro.

- You don't want to limit yourself to shared parameters
- You want to limit yourself to parameters with a value
- You don't care about the name of the parameter, you care about the schema (TypeId)
- A small number of parameters are intentionally ignored as redundant (ELEM_CATEGORY_PARAM, ELEM_CATEGORY_PARAM_MT, ELEM_FAMILY_AND_TYPE_PARAM, SYMBOL_ID_PARAM, and ELEM_TYPE_PARAM)

Tobias Hathorn

oh great - thank you for calling all that out @Lou Bianchini - I’m not a Revit API expert but I can work w @Kevin Vandecar and @Greg Henry to tune this macro to what we’re looking for

@Andy Parrella I was just pinging @Krishna Kumar Pappu about the task he assigned to you and @Greg Henry at the last meeting (to test S, M, L models) is that what this XLSX is for? If so, maybe you do want to include more than just the shared params as Lou points out?

Yeah I guess so - maybe Greg can help with that? I would take longer to get it working, I bet

Maybe - it’s more of a Revit API specialization. I found this thread, and of course Jeremy Tammik could potentially help too.
