Hi Revit folks - I’m looking to do some data validation on parameters coming out of Revit headed to FDX (for the Power Automate workflow).
Are there any debug tools or other utilities in Revit so I can get a count / csv of Revit parameters on elements in a view?
@Andy Parrella @Dave Fagerstrom @Lou Bianchini @John Thomas @Angel Velez…?

@Tobias Hathorn I had made this spreadsheet that contains the parameters I extracted from some of the models - also attached is the macro I used...

Thank you @Andy Parrella!
I believe @Greg Henry already saw this, but pinging here for follow up questions in thread - I’ll try out the utility!

Lou Bianchini

@Tobias Hathorn Note there are several things you'd want to change about that macro.

- You don't want to limit yourself to shared parameters
- You want to limit yourself to parameters with a value
- You don't care about the name of the parameter, you care about the schema (TypeId)
- A small number of parameters are intentionally ignored as redundant (ELEM_CATEGORY_PARAM, ELEM_CATEGORY_PARAM_MT, ELEM_FAMILY_AND_TYPE_PARAM, SYMBOL_ID_PARAM, and ELEM_TYPE_PARAM)

Tobias Hathorn

oh great - thank you for calling all that out @Lou Bianchini - I’m not a Revit API expert but I can work w @Kevin Vandecar and @Greg Henry to tune this macro to what we’re looking for

Tobias Hathorn 

@Andy Parrella I was just pinging @Krishna Kumar Pappu about the task he assigned to you and @Greg Henry at the last meeting (to test S, M, L models) is that what this XLSX is for? If so, maybe you do want to include more than just the shared params as Lou points out?

Andy Parrella 

Yeah I guess so - maybe Greg can help with that? I would take longer to get it working, I bet

Tobias Hathorn 

Maybe - it’s more of a Revit API specialization. I found this thread, and of course Jeremy Tammik could potentially help too.

@Tobias Hathorn, @Mikako Harada, @Augusto Goncalves: I implemented a POC of RvtParamDrop. The attached CSV is generated by dumping all instance and type parameter values of all elements (and all recursively referenced elements) visible in Level 1 in the House.rvt sample model.

Thank you! Jeremy!!

Jeremy Tammik 

@Tobias Hathorn you need to verify a couple of things: (i) all elements of interest and all their references were included (ii) all parameter values of interest were included (iii) for each parameter value, all required data fields were included. i am pretty sure that at least (iii) will need some tweaking. a final aspect may be (iv) too much data included. but, as @Lou Bianchini said, who are we to judge what is needed?

Tobias Hathorn

@Jeremy Tammik this is amazing. Thank you for this!  One request - does this add-in work on a 3D view as well? Exchanges only extract from 3D views. Could you provide a sample drop from SHARE - Overall ? Or we can have a short meeting next week and you can teach me to use your utility?

(i) - I’ll need to coordinate w @Srinivasan Jayaraman or @Greg Henry or @Denis Grigor to create a drop from a Data Exchange of the same 3D view. We’ll do a diff and compare!
(ii) same as above. One of the first things to test is that the HostElemID is useful as a key to match up the two drops. Perhaps we’ll need the Revit GUID in addition.
(iii) makes sense. No feedback on that yet.
(iv) yes, we’re opting for a “more is more” philosophy at the moment - we will have a Private Beta with a few customers soon, so, we’ll get some feedback on this topic.

Thank you again for developing this PoC!
